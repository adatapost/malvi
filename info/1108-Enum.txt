The enum type
=============

-> The "enum" keyword defines an enum datatype that is used to define symbolic constant to enhance the
   code readability.
-> In fact, enum is a kind of class but it cannot support inheritance.

-> enum members can be :
      1. enum identifiers - which are static by default
      2. private fields and public or package-level private methods
      3. private constructor - because enum cannot be instanted outside its definition. 

-> The enum is instantiate inside the enum when you define enum identifiers. It is important to note that the enum identifier appears at the very begining of the enum definition.

Example: Simple enum type to represent day name

enum Day {
  Mon,
  Tue,
  Wed,
  Thr,
  Fri,
  Sat,
  Sun
}

code in main:

       Day day = Day.Sat;

       if( day == Day.Mon ) {
           System.out.println("Welcome to the school!!");
       }

       switch (day) {
           case Mon:
           case Tue:
           case Wed:
               System.out.println("Super days!!!");
               break;
           case Thr:
           case Fri:
               System.out.println("Lazy days!!!");

           case Sat:
           case Sun:
               System.out.println("Weekend!!!");
       }

IMPORTATN: In above definition of Day enum, Mon, Tue,....are instances of Day enum. We do not have to create instances of enum explicitly.

Example: Complex enum type which saves additional details

enum Friend {
  Reena(10,"Meh"),   //first instance
  Meena(20,"Sur"),   //second instance
  Seema(12,"Pat")

  //private fields and a constructor to represent age and city
  private int age;
  private String city;
  private Friend(int age, String city) { this.age = age; this.city = city; }
  //public getters
  public int getAge() { return age; }
  public String getCity() { return city;}
}

code in main:

  Friend myBest = Friend.Meena;

  System.out.println(myBest + " friend is from " + myBest.getCity() 
       + " and is " + myBest.getAge() + " years old.");

Example:

public enum Program {
   BCA(6,30000),
   MCA(6,45000),
   BE(8,60000)

   //semester and fees
   .....
}
